# IL-2 Squad

Django-based website for IL-2 squadrons, with an emphasis on statistics.

This project is in a very early stage of development.

## Goals

* Scrape [il2stats](https://github.com/vaal-/il2_stats) based sites for sorties and results
* Assign points to pilots' achievements according to JG27's scoring system
* Provide user (pilot) management with stats pages
* Discord bot that updates a Discord server with results
* ...

Even later, this might be extended to provide an IL-2 squad homepage with a simple content management system.
